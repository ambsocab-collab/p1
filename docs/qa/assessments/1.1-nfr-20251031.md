# NFR Assessment: Story 1.1

Date: 2025-10-31
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

Non-functional requirements assessment for project setup story. All basic NFRs are addressed with appropriate configurations, though some production-hardening items remain pending.

## Security Assessment

### Status: CONCERNS

**Findings:**
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured in .gitignore
- ✅ Supabase uses secure authentication patterns
- ⚠️ No runtime validation for environment variables (high risk)
- ⚠️ Missing security headers configuration for Vercel deployment
- ⚠️ No rate limiting or authentication guards implemented yet

**Recommendations:**
- Implement environment variable validation at application startup
- Configure security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.) in Vercel
- Add pre-commit hooks for secret scanning

## Performance Assessment

### Status: PASS

**Findings:**
- ✅ Vite configured for optimal build performance
- ✅ Code splitting and lazy loading ready with React Router
- ✅ Image optimization placeholder in place
- ✅ Build tools configured for production optimization

**Metrics:**
- Build time: < 30 seconds (expected)
- Bundle size: Optimized with Vite's default configurations
- Runtime performance: React 18 with concurrent features

## Reliability Assessment

### Status: PASS

**Findings:**
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline comprehensive with test, lint, build, and E2E stages
- ✅ Error handling setup in tests
- ✅ Deployment pipeline with artifact management
- ⚠️ No monitoring/alerting configured yet

**Recommendations:**
- Set up error monitoring (Sentry or similar)
- Configure health checks for production

## Maintainability Assessment

### Status: PASS

**Findings:**
- ✅ TypeScript configuration strict and comprehensive
- ✅ ESLint and Prettier configured for code consistency
- ✅ Monorepo structure well-organized with clear separation
- ✅ Path aliases configured for clean imports
- ✅ Documentation present (README, env templates)

**Code Quality Metrics:**
- TypeScript strict mode: Enabled
- ESLint rules: Configured with React best practices
- Code formatting: Prettier with Tailwind plugin

## Summary

| NFR Category | Status | Score | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|-------|
| Security | CONCERNS | 70 | Basic security in place, needs runtime validation |
| Performance | PASS | 90 | Build tools optimized for performance |
| Reliability | PASS | 85 | CI/CD robust, monitoring pending |
| Maintainability | PASS | 95 | Excellent code organization and tooling |

**Overall NFR Score: 85/100**

The project setup demonstrates strong attention to non-functional requirements with modern tooling and best practices. Security concerns around environment validation should be addressed before production deployment.
